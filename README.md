## Hello there! I'm Thisa. :wave:

I find modern and emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence fascinating :dependabot: so I'm on a journey to learn more about it and how I can do it myself. I find coding really fun too because of the way I have to think to solve the problem and it's so satisfying to finally get it. My ccurrent goal is to become a full-stack developer and work on AI and other interesting technologies. :electron:
